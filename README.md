Temporary Game title : Wild_Life

1. Game Type: 2D Object Platformer
2. Main Theme: Adventure of the main characters Ben, Slash, and Gem
3. Story: 'Read Wild_Life', the plan for the game is to be until chapter 1 or 2 (when they group up with Princess Pelissa and get into the jungle, we might say 'to be continued' or else.. If possible we make the game until Chapter 3.)
4. Main Goal from us: implement physical gravity and several obstacles to let the game has general difficulty
5. Main Goal for users: entertain them with understandable game mechanism and the main storyline.
